# Odev Solution Development Pre-Assessment  
## Library Management System

This repository contains my submission for the **Odev Solution Pre-Assessment Exercise – Library Management System** for Odev Solutions.

---

## Environment & Approach

- Development was done using an existing Odoo environment in **PyCharm**.
- Odoo Version: **18.0.1.0**
- The pre-existing **Library module** was extended and modified to implement the required features:
  - Added an **Author field** to the Book model.
  - Ensured **Book Categories are unique**.
  - Updated views to support the new fields and constraints.

---

## Verification

The solution can be tested by:

1. Creating a new Book Category.
2. Attempting to create a duplicate category (should be restricted).
3. Creating a new Book and assigning an Author and Category.
